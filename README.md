### Focus
- Streaming / realtime events → **deterministic UI state** (messages · widgets · thread)
- **Conversation consistency**: regeneration/deletion boundaries & multi-item thread modeling
- **Reliability**: cancel / retry / error recovery + state synchronization
- **Complex admin systems**: hierarchical domain + search/filter + query-state sync
- **Operational readiness**: observability + CI quality gates to prevent regressions
